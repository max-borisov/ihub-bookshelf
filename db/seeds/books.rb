      description: '
  <p>Does your Rails code suffer from bloat, brittleness, or inaccuracy? Cure these problems with a regular dose of test-driven development. Rails 4 Test Prescriptions is a comprehensive guide to how tests can help you design and write better Rails applications. In this completely revised edition, you\'ll learn why testing works and how to test effectively using Rails 4, Minitest 5, and RSpec 3, as well as popular testing libraries such as factory_girl and Cucumber. Do what the doctor ordered to make your applications feel all better. Side effects may include better code, fewer bugs, and happier developers.</p>

  <p>Your Ruby on Rails application is sick. Deadlines are looming, but every time you make the slightest change to the code, something else breaks. Nobody remembers what that tricky piece of code was supposed to do, and nobody can tell what it actually does. Plus, it has bugs. You need test-driven development, a process for improving the design, maintainability, and long-term viability of software.</p>

  <p>Containing both practical code examples and discussion of why testing works, this book starts with the most basic features delivered as part of core Ruby on Rails. Once you\'ve integrated those features into your coding practice, you\'ll learn how to use popular third-party testing tools such as RSpec, Mocha, Cucumber, and factory_girl. You\'ll test the component parts of a Rails application, including the back-end model logic and the front-end display logic. Using Rails examples, you\'ll learn how to use testing to enable your code to respond better to future change. Plus, you\'ll see how to handle real-world testing situations.</p>

  <p>This completely revised edition contains a new tutorial, as well as new examples throughout the book. Many chapters, including the JavaScript chapter, have undergone major changes to reflect new tools and new practices. And there are brand new chapters on testing for security, and testing external services.</p>

Filled with useful tasks to improve the maintainability of your applications</p>

  <h5>Who This Book Is For</h5>
  <p>This book is for professional PHP developers who wish to master the powerful Yii 2 application framework. It is assumed that you have knowledge of object-oriented programming. The previous version of the Yii framework is only briefly mentioned, but it\'ll be even easier to grasp Yii 2 with the knowledge of Yii 1.1.x.</p>

  <h5>In Detail</h5>
  <p>Yii is a high performance PHP framework used for rapid web application development. It is well designed, well supported, easy to learn, and easy to maintain. This book embraces the learn-by-example methodology to show you the most important features of the Yii 2 framework. Throughout the course of this book, you will build a simple real-world application; each chapter will introduce you to a new functionality and show you how to tweak your application.

  <p>The Definitive Refactoring Guide, Fully Revamped for Ruby With refactoring, programmers can transform even the most chaotic software into well-designed systems that are far easier to evolve and maintain. What’s more, they can do it one step at a time, through a series of simple, proven steps. Now, there’s an authoritative and extensively updated version of Martin Fowler’s classic refactoring book that utilizes Ruby examples and idioms throughout–not code adapted from Java or any other environment.</p>

  <p>The authors introduce a detailed catalog of more than 70 proven Ruby refactorings, with specific guidance on when to apply each of them, step-by-step instructions for using them, and example code illustrating how they work. Many of the authors’ refactorings use powerful Ruby-specific features, and all code samples are available for download.</p>

  <p>Leveraging Fowler’s original concepts, the authors show how to perform refactoring in a controlled, efficient, incremental manner, so you methodically improve your code’s structure without introducing new bugs. Whatever your role in writing or maintaining Ruby code, this book will be an indispensable resource.</p>

  <p>This book will help you</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the core principles of refactoring and the reasons for doing it</li>
  <li>Recognize “bad smells” in your Ruby code</li>
  <li>Rework bad designs into well-designed code, one step at a time</li>
  <li>Build tests to make sure your refactorings work properly</li>
  <li>Understand the challenges of refactoring and how they can be overcome</li>
  <li>Compose methods to package code properly</li>
  <li>Move features between objects to place responsibilities where they fit best</li>
  <li>Organize data to make it easier to work with</li>
  <li>Simplify conditional expressions and make more effective use of polymorphism</li>
  <li>Create interfaces that are easier to understand and use</li>
  <li>Generalize more effectively</li>
  <li>Perform larger refactorings that transform entire software systems and may take months or years</li>
